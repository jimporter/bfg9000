# When creating libraries for other projects to use, it's common to generate
# pkg-config info to make it easier for users of the library to, well, use it.
# Of course, you first have to define your build and specify the appropriate
# files to install:

project('hello', '1.0')

ogg = package('ogg')

include = header_directory('include', include='*.hpp')
inner = library('inner', files=['src/inner.cpp'], packages=[ogg])
lib = library('hello', files=['src/hello.cpp'], includes=[include],
              libs=[inner])

install(lib, include)

# From there, you can call the pkg_config() function to create a pkg-config .pc
# file. There are numerous options available, but the ones below are the most
# important:

hello_pkg = pkg_config(
    # Every package needs a name, since that's how pkg-config looks them up!
    'hello',
    # Packages must also have versions so that users of the package can set
    # the required version.
    version='1.0',
    # Most packages have include files; these can be header files or header
    # directories.
    includes=[include],
    # Libraries are also a common part of packages; if a library listed here
    # depends on another library or a package, it will automatically be
    # included in the pkg-config info.
    libs=[lib],
    # By default, auto_fill is True and will automatically fill the above
    # fields with sensible defaults. If False, only the values you explicitly
    # specify will be used.
    auto_fill=False
)

# You can even use the pkg-config package you just created when building other
# binaries. However, this is only allowed when auto_fill is false, since
# bfg9000 won't know what an auto-filled pkg-config .pc file would look like
# until after the build script is finished.

sample = executable('sample', 'sample.cpp', packages=[hello_pkg])
install(sample)
